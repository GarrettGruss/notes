**Q:** Imagine that your application will need to run two always-on f1.2xlarge instances (which come with instance storage and won't require any EBS volumes). To meet seasonal demand, you can expect to require as many as four more instances for a total of 100 hours through the course of a single year. How should you pay for this deployment? Bonus: Calculate your total estimated monthly and annual costs.

**A:** Purchase 2x f1.2xlarge on a three-year term. Purchase 100 hours of f1.2xlarge on-demand.
cost = 2x12x$146.00/Month + 100x$0.362/Hour=$3_540.2
