```
A piece of software that performs a business function. Requirements can be applied to logical components to define their responsibilities and behaviors that developers will implement.

Structure of a system's logical components and the actors, external interfaces they interact with.
### Physical Architecture

    ServiceA --> DB1[(Database)]

    ServiceC --> Queue[ðŸ“¨ Message Queue]
    
    Queue --> ServiceD[Service D]

    style DB1 fill:#1e5091,color:#fff
    style DB2 fill:#1e5091,color:#fff
```
Structure of a system's code that implements the logic of the components.
### Component Coupling
When components communicate with each other, or when a change to one compo nent might impact other components, the components are said to be coupled together. The more coupled a systemâ€™s components are, the harder it is to maintain and test the system (see Figure 8-11). Therefore, itâ€™s important to pay close attention to coupling.


```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Order Shipment] --> B[Customer Notification]
```
Components coupled because they are communicating

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class OrderPlacement {
    }
    
    class OrderShipment {
    }
    
    OrderPlacement *-- OrderShipment : creates
```
Components coupled because a change in one impacts the other, even though they aren't communicating

### Static Coupling
Occurs when components communicate synchronously with each other. Architects need to be concerned about two types of coupling: afferent and efferent.

- **Afferent Coupling**: The degree to which other components depend on a target component.
- **Efferent Coupling**: The degree to which a target component depends on other components.
### The Law of Demeter/loose coupling
A component or service should have limited knowledge of other components or services.

## Processes

### Creating logical architecture

Logical architecture describes the structure and behavior of the system, and the external objects the system interacts with. The process to create a logical architecure is:

- Identify the core components
- Assign responsibilities to core components
- refactor based on core system requirements


### Workflow Approach
A common approach architects use for identifying the initial core components of a logical architecture is the Workflow approach. Identify the workflow a user might take through the system and allocate components to each action.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    start((start)) --> A
    subgraph user [user actions]
        A[User browses the catalog of items] --> B[User places an order]
        B --> C[User pays for the order]
        C --> D[Send user an email with order details]
    end
    
    %% Components serving each user action
    IB[Item Browser Service] --- A
    IB ~~~ OP
    OP[Order Placement Service] --- B
    OPay[Order Payment Service] --- C
    CN1[Customer Notification Service] --- D

    %% Style components as blue
    classDef componentStyle fill:#4A90E2,stroke:#2E5C8A,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    class IB,OP,OPay,CN1,OF,OS,CN2,OT componentStyle
```

### Actor/Action Approach

Another way architects identify initial core components is the Actor/Action approach. This approach is particularly useful when a system has multiple actors.
- Identify the major business logic performed
- Identify the actors and systems
- Identify the actions each actor and system can take
- Allocate the actions to the business logic
