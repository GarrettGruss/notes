## Writing an Abstract

- Define the problem: This is what the customer is struggling with.
- Define why this data is being used: Is this the only data we have access to, is other data old and irrelevant?
- Modelling Technique: Reference the model used, the credibility of the model, etc.
- Results: What are we trying to demonstrate.

If you reference models or techniques from reputable, peer-reviewed articles, the weight of your arguement is significantly stronger. Be sure to cite the original published work where you sourced the model.
